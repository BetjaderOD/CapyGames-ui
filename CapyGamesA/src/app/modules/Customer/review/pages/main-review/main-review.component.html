        Learn one way to build applications with Angular and reuse your code and
        abilities to build apps for any deployment target. For web, mobile web,
        native mobile and native desktop.
      </p>

      <h3>Speed &amp; Performance</h3>
      <p>
        Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take it
        further, via Web Workers and server-side rendering. Angular puts you in
        control over scalability. Meet huge data requirements by building data
        models on RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model.
      </p>

      <h3>Incredible tooling</h3>
      <p>
        Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates. Extend the
        template language with your own components and use a wide array of existing
        components. Get immediate Angular-specific help and feedback with nearly
        every IDE and editor. All this comes together so you can focus on building
        amazing apps rather than trying to make the code work.
      </p>

      <h3>Loved by millions</h3>
      <p>
        From prototype through global deployment, Angular delivers the productivity
        and scalable infrastructure that supports Google's largest applications.
      </p>

      <h3>What is Angular?</h3>

      <p>
        Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web.
        Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end
        tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges.
        Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web,
        mobile, or the desktop
